#Development Workflow
`master` branch only holds the latest stable version of the product. Navigate to `dev` branch in order to see latest work.

##Pull Requests &amp; Branching
Every feature must be developed under a so-called feature branch and that branch must be brached off from `dev` branch.

*Pull Requests* should be targeted to `dev` branch, not `master`! Before sending the PR, make sure you have the latest `dev` branch merged into you feature branch.
